# Prototype Multiple DraftJS RTE editors

This is a simple Proof of Concept repo to demo running multiple RTE Editors to identify any performance bottlenecks.

It is bootstrapped with CRA & the `redux-typescript` template.

## Installation

Clone the repo, `cd` into it and run

```
// npm
npm install
npm run start
```

The app should run on the first available port `300x`
